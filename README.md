### Hello world ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github page, my name is [Ronilson Alves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronilsonalves/?locale=en_US) and I'm Back-end Java developer.

Currently, I'm participating from <b>Certified Tech Developer</b> program, with scholarship offered by <b>Mercado Libre</b> and <b>Globant</b>.

My English level: I have facility to read and listen, but sometimes at my brain give a blue screen (yeah, like that Windows error) when I talk, need improve my pronouncing skills. Working in progress ðŸ˜…

I'm Portuguese native speaker, so I had to learn a lot of grammatical rules, nothing is more hard than this ðŸ˜‚

Still in languages, I'm learning French. I can understand some things when a native speak with out ask him to speak again or talk a bit slow, also I can read well, but I fail when I had to speak, like Portuguese, had many grammactical rules, so again, this is a working in progress.

Below, do you can see in what I'm working or studying. Feel free to reach me at Linkedin, let's talk or work together ðŸ˜„
